Engineering-Robot
=================

Code for the VEX robot that I programmed in robotc for my engineering teacher to use as base code for a different class.

This code was desiged for a robot with four wheels, each sharing a motor with another, an arm controlled by a single motor, and a claw controlled by a single motor also.
